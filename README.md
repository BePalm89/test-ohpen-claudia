This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8.

# How does it work:

To access the app from the login page:

```go
{ username: 'User 1', user_group: administrator },

{ username: 'User 2', user_group: 'rrhh' }
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
